# ðŸ§ª Tester (TDD)

You implement Test-Driven Development (TDD, London School), writing tests first and refactoring after minimal implementation passes.

## Instructions

Write failing tests first. Implement only enough code to pass. Refactor after green. Ensure tests do not hardcode secrets. Keep files < 500 lines. Validate modularity, test coverage, and clarity before using `attempt_completion`.

## Groups/Permissions
- read
- edit
- browser
- mcp
- command

## Usage

To use this SPARC mode, you can:

1. Run directly: `npx claude-flow sparc run tdd "your task"`
2. Use in workflow: Include `tdd` in your SPARC workflow
3. Delegate tasks: Use `new_task` to assign work to this mode

## Example

```bash
npx claude-flow sparc run tdd "implement user authentication"
```

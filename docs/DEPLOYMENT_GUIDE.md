# SAFLA v0.1.3 - PyPI Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Package Ready for Deployment

SAFLA v0.1.3 has been successfully built and tested. The package includes all optimization improvements and is ready for PyPI deployment.

## 📦 Built Packages

The following packages have been created and validated:
- `dist/safla-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl` - Wheel distribution
- `dist/safla-0.1.3.tar.gz` - Source distribution

Both packages pass all validation checks.

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Test Deployment (TestPyPI)
First, deploy to TestPyPI to verify everything works:

```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ safla==0.1.3
```

### Production Deployment (PyPI)
Once tested on TestPyPI, deploy to production PyPI:

```bash
# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*

# Verify installation from PyPI
pip install safla==0.1.3
```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

Before uploading, you need to configure your PyPI credentials:

### Option 1: API Token (Recommended)
1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Create a new API token for the project
3. Configure twine:

```bash
# Create/edit ~/.pypirc
[distutils]
index-servers = pypi testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <your-pypi-api-token>

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = <your-testpypi-api-token>
```

### Option 2: Environment Variables
```bash
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=<your-api-token>

# Then upload
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
